/*
    solver : {'auto', 'svd', 'cholesky', 'lsqr', 'sparse_cg', 'sag', 'saga'}
        Solver to use in the computational routines:

        - 'auto' chooses the solver automatically based on the type of data.

        - 'svd' uses a Singular Value Decomposition of X to compute the Ridge
          coefficients. More stable for singular matrices than
          'cholesky'.

        - 'cholesky' uses the standard scipy.linalg.solve function to
          obtain a closed-form solution.

        - 'sparse_cg' uses the conjugate gradient solver as found in
          scipy.sparse.linalg.cg. As an iterative algorithm, this solver is
          more appropriate than 'cholesky' for large-scale data
          (possibility to set `tol` and `max_iter`).

        - 'lsqr' uses the dedicated regularized least-squares routine
          scipy.sparse.linalg.lsqr. It is the fastest but may not be available
          in old scipy versions. It also uses an iterative procedure.

        - 'sag' uses a Stochastic Average Gradient descent, and 'saga' uses
          its unbiased and more flexible version named SAGA. Both methods
          use an iterative procedure, and are often faster than other solvers
          when both n_samples and n_features are large. Note that 'sag' and
          'saga' fast convergence is only guaranteed on features with
          approximately the same scale. You can preprocess the data with a
          scaler from sklearn.preprocessing.
