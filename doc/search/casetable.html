Nodes encode formalization-specific rest problems, but the search is conducted to identify an object of some object space S.
Such an object should, by definition, always be creatable from a path to a goal node in the traversal tree.

Intuitively, does the way <emph>how</emph> one reaches a node in the original graph affect the question whether the path is a solution? If not, then any path to such a node is a solution, and then the solution property can be checked locally for the node.</td>
